So this is my first major coding project. 
What it does is detect a button push and then triggers a countdown from a 4 digit 7-segmented led.
After the countdown a PiCamera on the RPi will take and store the picture.
The countdown is reset and is triggered for 3 more times.
The 4 images are then stitched together with an added logo.
Using Twitter's API, it will then upload them to the bot account automatically once done.
